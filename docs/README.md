# Analytics

Analytics is the gathering, understanding and application of data to measure, improve and make sites smarter.

## Google Tag Manager

There are many 3rd party providers of analytics so this module provides a simple interface to add [Google Tag Manager](https://tagmanager.google.com/) containers, the recommended way to add and manage 3rd party JavaScript on your site.

Google Tag Manager provides comprehensive integration with [Google Analytics](google-tag-manager/google-analytics.md), [Google Optimise](google-tag-manager/optimise.md) and other tools in the 360 suite. Additionally there is built in support for services including [ChartBeat](https://chartbeat.com/), [comScore](https://www.comscore.com/), [Parse.ly](https://www.parse.ly/), [Hotjar](https://www.hotjar.com/) and [many more](https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/6106924).

[Conversion tracking](google-tag-manager/conversion-tracking.md) can also be handled through GTM and the data collected used to set up [remarketing](google-tag-manager/remarketing.md).
